=Flickr Slurp=

I have a lot of pictures on flickr and, post delicious chicanary, I wanted to be able to get them down. 

So here it is.

Everything gets put into the folder structure:

YYYY/MM/DD

Each picture has an associated xml file which contains meta information (tags, title, description right now.  Notes, people, and geo would be nice)
